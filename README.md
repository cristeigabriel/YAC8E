# YAC8E
Yet Another Chip-8 Emulator

# Purpose
This is a learning project for me (Cristei Gabriel-Marian [@cristeigabriel]), meant to help others understand the Chip-8 architecture and inner workings while I do the same, but through direct work and experimenting, which I recommend that all likewise interested people do.

This project will include documentation to the topmost of my knowledge and of others within my ability and of the (possible) contributors to this project.

# Platform
YAC8E is officially developed on Windows, providing an out of the box ready experience for Visual Studio Community (2019) users, working on the most default of toolchains.

YAC8E MIGHT be ported to Linux one day, but it is not yet confirmed or in plans.

# Customization
YAC8E allows for chip core elements and delimiters to be customized widely, but it is not a great idea to take upon it without knowledge of what you're doing, so watch out.

# Support
To see what instructions YAC8E supports and currently has, refer [here](https://github.com/cristeigabriel/YAC8E/blob/main/chip-8/chip-8.h) at CChip8<>::ComputeInstruction(...)

# Licensing
Do whatever the fuck you want with this, but put me (and contributors) somewhere there if you plan on using my project. Also, I'm not eligible to be held accountable for anything that you might be doing with this. It is solely your responsability.
